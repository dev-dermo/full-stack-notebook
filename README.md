# Full Stack Notebook

## Golden Rules
* **No spaces** in file, folder, or repo names
* Pay attention to and match letter/word casing 
* Always `pull` before `push` (when working collaboratively)
* Commit early, commit often

## Some common command line/terminal commands:

* To change directory: `cd /path/to/folder`
* To print out current working directory: `pwd`
* `.` refers to the current directory
* `..` refers to the parent directory, example usage: `cd ..` to go up one level
* To print out the contents of the current directory: `ls`, can be expanded with more information add the `-la` flags, eg. `ls -la`
